# What Growth Mindset Means to Me:

Growth mindset is active. Growth has to live; growth mindset has to live in thought activity, until it may become passive action, in the areas that may need improvement. Growth mindset means acknowledging when our own understanding is providing a block that may be showing up as an emotional response. Actively working past that block in understanding.

### **Growth Mindset Reminders**

1. Ask myself if I encountered a challenge/obstacle that I could learn from
2. Remind myself that I can learn something from every event in life.
3. Remember that choosing to grow is the first step; and making that choice everyday.
