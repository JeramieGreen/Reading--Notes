# My Day 06 Reading Notes:


Four things that make a computer a computer; input, storage, processing, and output.

input - the things that we add to the computer.

storage - everything we do on an input is stored in memory on a computer 

Processing - the computerâ€™s processor takes and processes that information from the storage using algorithms or a series of commands. 

Output - the processed information is then placed back in storage until the info is ready for the output

The binary system multiplies the number values x2. To say the n 

A not circut will flip what the output gives you. If I input a 1 I will receive a 0 on the output.
