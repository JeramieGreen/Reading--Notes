# Day 08 Notes


## **types of operators**

Assignment operators

Comparison operators

Arithmetic operators

Bitwise operators

Logical operators

String operators

Conditional (ternary) operator

Comma operator

Unary operators

Relational operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

Name	Shorthand operator	Meaning

Assignment	x = y	x = y

Addition assignment	x += y	x = x + y

Subtraction assignment	x -= y	x = x - y

Multiplication assignment	x *= y	x = x * y

Division assignment	x /= y	x = x / y

Remainder assignment	x %= y	x = x % y

Exponentiation assignment	x **= y	x = x ** y

Left shift assignment	x <<= y	x = x << y

Right shift assignment	x >>= y	x = x >> y

Unsigned right shift assignment	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y

Bitwise AND assignment	x &= y	x = x & y

Bitwise XOR assignment	x ^= y	x = x ^ y

Bitwise OR assignment	x |= y	x = x | y

Logical AND assignment	x &&= y	x && (x = y)

Logical OR assignment	x ||= y	x || (x = y)

Logical nullish assignment	x ??= y	x ?? (x = y)
