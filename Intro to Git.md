# Today's Notes 

Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) - collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files

Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) - allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

Git is a DVCS
 Snapshots - Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. 

File States - committed, modified, and staged

Committed - Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified - File has been changed but not committed to the database

Staged - Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

git init - initializes git repo

Track one file only by using the following format:
git add filename

You can change the title by editing the _config.yml file in your repository
